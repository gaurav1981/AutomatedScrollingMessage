# AutomatedScrollingMessage
Reusable Automated Scrolling Message Control for iOS Apps

This project accompanies the tutorial on my website (http://www.iosinsight.com) which goes step by step through building and using an Automated Scrolling Message control for iOS apps.

The tutorial is a great example for seeing an app built from the ground up.

You can see the tutorial here:  

If you want to use the control in your own apps, feel free to do so by copying the AutomatedScrollView folder from this project into your app according to your own project structure preferences.

My contact information is on my website should you have feedback or inquiries.
